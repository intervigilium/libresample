This project requires:
Android SDK
Android NDK

This project does not contain the shared libraries for LAME.
In order to build them, you must first install the Android NDK from:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Installing the Android NDK is beyond the scope of this INSTALL file.

To build the libraries you must go to /path/to/libresample and issue the command:
/path/to/ndk-build 

The NDK builder will compile the shared libraries and place them in the 
libresample/libs directory for use by other dependant projects.
